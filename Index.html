    <!-- paragraphs for my bio -->
    <!-- skipping line and making a horizontal line after each paragrah -->
    <p>My name is Yasr Jappie and I am a young aspiring software engineering looking to constantly broaden my knowledge and skills
        to become diverse and skilled in many areas of the software world. I was born in Cape Town, South Africa and have stayed here
        throughout my life. 
        <br><hr>
        
        I attended my primary and high school in Cape Town and then did my first year of University at Stellenbosch in the faculty of 
        electrical and electronic engineering. I was not enjoying the course and decided to defer my studies after the first year and that is how I 
        ended up at Hyperiondev.
        <br><hr>
    
        I am mixed martial artist and a jiu jitsu fanantic. I have been fighting since high school as my school did not offer any sports and 
        a teacher of mine introduced me to muay thai and from then I have always been hooked. In 2022 I made the Western Cape provincial team
        and fought at nationals in Johannesburg.
